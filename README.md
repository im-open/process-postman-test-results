# process-postman-test-results

This action works in conjunction with another step that runs Postman tests.  That step should include a json reporter like the following npm script:
`"postman": "newman run postman_collection.json -r cli,json -reporter-json-export postman-results.json"`.  

This action takes the json file and creates a Status Check or PR Comment depending on the flags set with the test outcome.  This action does not execute the tests itself, it relies on a previous step to run the Postman tests.  It can only process one result file.

## Failures

The status check can be an item on the workflow run, a PR comment or on the PR Status Check section.  If the test results contain failures, the status check will be marked as failed. Having the status check marked as failed will prevent PRs from being merged. If this status check behavior is not desired, the `ignore-test-failures` input can be set and the outcome will be marked as neutral if test failures are detected. The status badge shown in the comment or status check body will still indicate a failure.

## Limitations

GitHub does have a size limitation of 65535 characters for a Status Check body or a PR Comment.  This action will fail if the test results exceed the GitHub limit.  To mitigate this size issue only failed tests are included in the output.

If you have multiple workflows triggered by the same `pull_request` or `push` event, GitHub creates one checksuite for that commit.  The checksuite gets assigned to one of the workflows randomly and all status checks for that commit are reported to that checksuite. That means if there are multiple workflows with the same trigger, your status checks may show on a different workflow run than the run that created them.

## Usage Examples

### npm setup

1. Some npm scripts have also been added to the project

    ```json
    "scripts": {
      "postman": "newman run postman_collection.json -r cli,json -reporter-json-export postman-results.json"
    }
    ```

## Contributing

When creating new PRs please ensure:

1. For major or minor changes, at least one of the commit messages contains the appropriate `+semver:` keywords listed under [Incrementing the Version](#incrementing-the-version).
1. The action code does not contain sensitive information.

When a pull request is created and there are changes to code-specific files and folders, the build workflow will run and it will recompile the action and push a commit to the branch if the PR author has not done so. The usage examples in the README.md will also be updated with the next version if they have not been updated manually. The following files and folders contain action code and will trigger the automatic updates:

- action.yml
- package.json
- package-lock.json
- src/\*\*
- dist/\*\*

There may be some instances where the bot does not have permission to push changes back to the branch though so these steps should be done manually for those branches. See [Recompiling Manually](#recompiling-manually) and [Incrementing the Version](#incrementing-the-version) for more details.

### Recompiling Manually

If changes are made to the action's code in this repository, or its dependencies, the action can be re-compiled by running the following command:

```sh
# Installs dependencies and bundles the code
npm run build

# Bundle the code (if dependencies are already installed)
npm run bundle
```

These commands utilize [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/getting-started/#bundling-for-node) to bundle the action and
its dependencies into a single file located in the `dist` folder.

### Incrementing the Version

Both the build and PR merge workflows will use the strategies below to determine what the next version will be.  If the build workflow was not able to automatically update the README.md action examples with the next version, the README.md should be updated manually as part of the PR using that calculated version.

This action uses [git-version-lite] to examine commit messages to determine whether to perform a major, minor or patch increment on merge.  The following table provides the fragment that should be included in a commit message to active different increment strategies.
| Increment Type | Commit Message Fragment                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| major          | +semver:breaking                            |
| major          | +semver:major                               |
| minor          | +semver:feature                             |
| minor          | +semver:minor                               |
| patch          | *default increment type, no comment needed* |
